## Synopsis

1. Defining and Developing Algorithms
2. Experimental Analysis
3. Analytic Characterisation
4. Big $O$ notation

---

## Goal

> **formally** define an algorithm

--

## Goal

> **understand** how we compare the **performance** of different algorithms

--

## Goal

Counting *fundamental operations*

Performance for different *cases*
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

*Run-time complexity* as a function of problem size
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

## How Good is an Algorithm?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

> in plain English...

Note: Knowing how to compare algorithms is important so you can make sure you are 
using the correct one for the job at hand!

It would be very useful information if you could tell that sorting 
algorithm a is expected to take x amount of time to sort products on your
website vs. algorithm b that is expected to take x*x

--

## Time and Space

Time complexity - How *long* does it take to run?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Space complexity - How much *memory* does it need?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

## Time and Space

Often a trade-off!

Note:
Typically this is a trade-off, where algorithms that reduce time complexity 
may increase the space complexity, and vice versa.

--

## Time complexity

> We will focus on how long an algorithm takes to run!

Note: In your next year - you will explore in more depth!

---

## What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a finite **sequence** of unambiguous **instructions** for 
solving a **problem**, that will always **terminate**.

Note: A reminder of a formal definition of an algorithm.
Emphasise, always correct, and always terminate.
Etymology <https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Khwarizmi>

--

## What is an Algorithm?

Algorithms are *developed* through a process of *translation*, 
from an *informal* description to a *formal* description

--

**Formal** descriptions are written in **pseudo code**

--

## Developing Algorithms

### **Specification**
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### **Inputs**
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### **Outputs**
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: Three things we need to know? 
What should it do? Feasible inputs, outputs or effect?

--

#### Developing Algorithms 

> The first level of understanding is the human one. 
> You should be able to explain in plain terms how the algorithm works.

--

#### Developing Algorithms

> The second level is a more detailed, but still informal description 
> that breaks the problem down into sub-problems.

Note: some algorithms may deal with problems 
too trivial to significantly break down.

--

#### Developing Algorithms

> The third level, is a detailed pseudo code description, with all stages 
> refined until the description is unambiguous.

--

#### Developing Algorithms

## *There is often more than one solution!*
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: It's worth stating...there may be more than one solution!

--

## Writing Pseudocode

There is no universally accepted pseudocode.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

It *should* be language independent.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: We will relax that rule to enable runnable code in the labs!
I don't want you to learn another language...

--

<div class="left-center">

pseudocode

```text
scanArray(array[1..n], key): boolean
    for i := 1 to n
        if key == array[i]
        return true
    return false
```

</div> 
<div class="right-center">

python

```python
def scan_values(key, values):
    for value in values:
        if value == key:
            return True
    return False

```

</div>

---

## Case Study

--

### Linear Scan Algorithm

1. *Specification*
    - return true if key is in array of $n$ values, else false
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

2. *Input*
    - array of size $n$,  element key
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

3. *Output*
    - boolean - true if key is found in array, else false
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


Note: What do I mean by values? What do I mean by a key?
We will just use integers for our example, but items could be any type.

--

### Informal Algorithm

See if we can find an item in a list that matches a key...

--

### Informal Algorithm

- Step through all items.
     - If we find a match, return true
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
     - Return false if not found.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

### Formal Algorithm

<div style="font-size: 1.85em;">

```text
scanArray(array[1..n], key): boolean
    for i := 1 to n
        if key == array[i]
        return true
    return false
```

</div>

---

# Question?

## How long will this algorithm take to run?

--

## Experimental Approach

![timer](../assets/img/clock.gif)

Note: Run the code, and use a stop watch...

--

### Experimental Approach

1. A large sample of inputs.
2. System time for each run.
3. Plot the results.

--

![linear scan](../assets/img/lin_scan_experiment.png)

Note: What can we say about this plot? 
How will this algorithm perform on your machine?

--

#### Challenges of Experimental Analysis

What machine the algorithm is being run on.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Multiple runs on the same hardware may be different.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

What if there are other processes running?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

#### Challenges of Experimental Analysis

A limited set of test inputs.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

An algorithm must be fully implemented.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:  
Experiments can be done only on a limited set of test inputs
 (and these inputs may be important).

An algorithm must be fully implemented in order to  study its running time experimentally.

### Moving Beyond Experimental Analysis

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
### Moving Beyond Experimental Analysis

Take an approach that allows us to...

* gain independence of hardware
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* no need for implementation
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* all possible inputs
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

### Time complexity

1. The size of the input array (i.e. size of $n$).
2. Where element `key` is within the array (if at all).

Note: we want to define the time complexity using only these factors

--

### Time complexity

We count the number of **fundamental operations** that are performed.

>These will be the same over multiple runs on any hardware 
>thus making comparisons between algorithms more informative.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

#### operations

<div style="font-size: 1.2em">

```text
loop:
    initialisation: i := 1
    comparison: i <= n
    update: i := i + 1

inside loop:
    key == array[i]
    return

after loop:
    return
```

</div>

--

To reiterate, we assess the time an algorithm takes

i.e. its *time complexity*

by counting the number of operations it performs.

--

We could include all operations...

but many are one-off and incidental to the overall runtime.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: I have already forgotten what all those operations were...

--

Therefore we choose a *fundamental operation* and **characterise** the 
algorithm by counting these fundamental operations.

Note: the time taken to execute a fundamental operation must 
be (approximately) the same whenever that operation is executed 
on any instance on the domain of an algorithm.

--

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
#### Which operations do we count?

<div style="font-size: 1.2em">

```text[7]
loop:
    initialisation: i := 1
    comparison: i <= n
    update: i := i + 1

inside loop:
    key == array[i]
    return

after loop:
    return
```

</div>

--

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
#### Which operations do we count?

we will only count the operation at the heart of the algorithm.

---

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
### Fundamental Operation

## `key == array[i]`

--

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
### Fundamental Operation

## How many times is the fundamental operation performed?

Note: we have defined the fundamental op, now how do we count...

--

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
### Fundamental Operation

**Two** things to consider...

**Size** of the input array
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

**Where** is ` key ` in the array
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


Note:
We want to find the number of ops for any value of n
e.g. not 6 or 12, but relative (e.g. n operations, or n*n, etc.)

There are different cases. 
This algorithm would be much faster if e is the first element 
(best case scenario is 1 operation) 
than if e isnâ€™t in the array at all (worst case scenario is n operations)

--

### Counting Fundamental Operations

Where ` key ` is in the array decides the **case**.

--

### Counting Fundamental Operations

operation   | count      | case
----------- | ---------- | --------
`key == array[1]`  | op is called once      | **best** case
`key == array[2]`  | op is called twice     |
 |...| 
`key == array[n]`  | op is called $n$ times | **worst** case

--

Generally, we assume the **worst** case.

`key == array[i]` is performed **$n$** times.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


Note:
Unless specifically asked to consider a different case... 
It makes sense to prepare for the worst so you know your algorithm 
will at least always work to a certain level even under the most 
pessimistic circumstances.

So in this case, the worst case is that if key==a[i] will be performed n times

---

### Why Assume the Worst Case?

> In good weather, a commercial airliner requires 150,000$l$ of fuel to cross the Atlantic ocean.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

> In poor weather, it requires 200,000$l$ of fuel.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

> In *most* circumstances it is unacceptable for an algorithm to fail.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: We can compare different cases, but prepare for the worst 
to guarantee the minimum that the algorithm can achieve.

--

## What actually **is** the worst case?

For all possible outcomes...
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

which is the one that results in the most work being carried out?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Linear Scan Time Complexity Function

## $$ t(n) = n $$

$t(n)$ is called the run time complexity function
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
## $$ t(n) = n $$

We have **characterised** our function for the *worst* case.

--

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
## $$ t(n) = n $$

We call this a *linear* time algorithm.

We say this is *order* **$n$**, or...
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### $$\mathcal{O}(n)$$
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
### Big $\mathcal{O}$ Notation

--

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
### Big $\mathcal{O}$ Notation

... describes the upper bound of the complexity.

--

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
### Big $\mathcal{O}$ Notation

$$\begin{aligned}
& f(n)  \text{ is }  \mathcal{O}(g(n))  \newline
& \iff \text{ for constants  } ~ c, ~ n_0 \newline
& f(n) \leq cg(n) \text{ for all } n \geq n_0
\end{aligned}$$

Note: More formally...if and only if, but don't worry about this one!
But, it does qualify that the condition applies for sufficiently large n.

--

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
### Big $\mathcal{O}$ Notation

![big o notation](../assets/diag/big-o-graph.drawio.svg)

$f(n) = \mathcal{O}(g(n))$

--

## $\Omega$

Just like $\mathcal{O}$ describes an *upper* bound, 

$\Omega$ describes a *lower* bound.

--

## $\Theta$

If we have upper and lower bounds

described by $\mathcal{O}$ and $\Omega$

$\Theta$ describes the set of functions *between* those bounds.
