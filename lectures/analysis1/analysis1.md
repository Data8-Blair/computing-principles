## Goal

To understand how we compare the performance of different algorithms

--

## Goal

- Counting fundamental operations.
- Understanding performance for different cases.
- Run-time complexity as a function of problem size.

--

## How Good is an Algorithm?

--

## Time complexity

How long does it take to run?

--

1. Time complexity - how long does it take?
2. Space complexity - how much memory does it need?

Note:
Typically this is a trade-off, where algorithms that reduce time complexity 
may increase the space complexity, and vice versa.
Knowing how to compare algorithms is important so you can make sure you are 
using the correct one for the job at hand!
It would be very useful information if you could tell that sorting 
algorithm a is expected to take x amount of time to sort products on your
website vs. algorithm b that is expected to take x*x

# Definitions

--

An asymptote of a curve is a line such that 
the distance between the curve
and the line approaches zero as one or
both of the x or y coordinates tends to infinity.

# Summation

We use the Greek letter 'Sigma' to denote summation.
