## Goal

> **formally** define an algorithm

--

## Goal

> **understand** how we compare the **performance** of different algorithms

--

## Goal

Counting *fundamental operations*

Performance for different *cases*
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

*Run-time complexity* as a function of problem size
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

## How Good is an Algorithm?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

> in plain English...

Note: Knowing how to compare algorithms is important so you can make sure you are 
using the correct one for the job at hand!

It would be very useful information if you could tell that sorting 
algorithm a is expected to take x amount of time to sort products on your
website vs. algorithm b that is expected to take x*x

--

## Time and Space

Time complexity - How *long* does it take to run?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Space complexity - How much *memory* does it need?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

## Time and Space

Often a trade-off!

Note:
Typically this is a trade-off, where algorithms that reduce time complexity 
may increase the space complexity, and vice versa.

--

## Time complexity

> We will focus on how long an algorithm takes to run!

Note: In your next year - you will explore in more depth!

---

## What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a finite **sequence** of unambiguous **instructions** for 
solving a **problem**, that will always **terminate**.

Note: A reminder of a formal definition of an algorithm.
Emphasise, always correct, and always terminate.

--

## What is an Algorithm?

Algorithms are *developed* through a process of *translation*, 
from an *informal* description to a *formal* description

--

**Formal** descriptions are written in **pseudo code**

--

## Developing Algorithms

### **Specification**
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### **Inputs**
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### **Outputs**
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: Three things we need to know? 
What should it do? Feasible inputs, outputs or effect?

--

## Developing Algorithms 

> The first level of understanding is the human one. 
> You should be able to explain in plain terms how the algorithm works.

--

## Developing Algorithms

> The second level is a more detailed, but still informal description 
> that breaks the problem down into sub-problems.

Note: some algorithms may deal with problems 
too trivial to significantly break down.

--

## Developing Algorithms

> The third level, is a detailed pseudo code description, with all stages 
> refined until the description is unambiguous.


--

## Developing Algorithms

## *There is likely more than one solution!*
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: It's worth stating...

---

## Writing Pseudocode

There is no universally accepted pseudocode.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

It *should* be language independent.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: We will relax that rule to enable runnable code in the labs!

## Case Study

--

### Linear Scan Algorithm

1. *Specification*
    - return true if key is in array of $n$ values, else false
2. *Input*
    - array of size $n$,  element key
3. *Output*
    - boolean - true if key is found in array, else false

--

### Formal algorithm

```text
scanArray(array[1..n], key): boolean
    for i := 1 to n
        if key == array[i]
        return true
    return false

```

# Question?

## How long will this algorithm take to run?

--

## A naive approach...

![timer](../assets/img/clock.gif)

Note: Run the code, and use a stop watch...

--

## Independent of hardware

Remove the variable of what machine the algorithm is being run on.

Multiple runs on the same hardware may be different...

What if there are other processes running?

--

### Time complexity

1. The size of the input array (i.e. size of $n$)
2. Where element `key` is within the array (if at all)

Note: we want to define the time complexity using only these factors

--

### Time complexity

We count the number of **fundamental operations** that are performed.

>These will be the same over multiple runs on any hardware 
>thus making comparisons between algorithms more informative.

--

#### algorithm

```text
scanArray(array[1..n], key): boolean
    for i := 1 to n
        if key == array[i]
        return true
    return false
```

#### operations

```text
loop:
    initialisation: i := 1
    comparison: i <= n
    update: i := i + 1

inside loop:
    key == array[i]
    return

after loop:
    return
```

--

To reiterate, we assess the time an algorithm takes

i.e. its *time complexity*

by counting the number of operations it performs.

--

We could include all operations...

but many are one-off and incidental to the overall runtime.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

Therefore we choose a *fundamental operation* and **characterise** the algorithm by counting these fundamental operations.

Note: the time taken to execute a fundamental operation must be (approximately) the same whenever that operation is executed on any instance on the domain of an algorithm.

--

#### Which operations do we count?

```text

loop:
    initialisation: i := 1
    comparison: i <= n
    update: i := i + 1

inside loop:
    key == array[i]
    return

after loop:
    return

```

--

#### Which operations do we count?

we will only count the operation at the heart of the algorithm.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Fundamental Operation

`key == array[i]`

--

### Fundamental Operation

How many times is the fundamental operation performed?

--

### Counting Fundamental Operations

**Two** things to consider...
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

**Size** of the input array
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

**Where** is ` key ` in the array
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


Note:
We want to find the number of ops for any value of n
e.g. not 6 or 12, but relative (e.g. n operations, or n*n, etc.)

There are different cases. 
This algorithm would be much faster if e is the first element 
(best case scenario is 1 operation) 
than if e isnâ€™t in the array at all (worst case scenario is n operations)

--

Where ` key ` is in the array decides the **case**.

--

### Counting Fundamental Operations

operation   | count      | case
----------- | ---------- | --------
`key == array[1]`  | op is called once      | **best** case
`key == array[2]`  | op is called twice     |
 |...| 
`key == array[n]`  | op is called $n$ times | **worst** case

--

Generally, we assume the worst case.

`key == array[i]` is performed $n$ times.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


Note:
Unless specifically asked to consider a different case... 
It makes sense to prepare for the worst so you know your algorithm 
will at least always work to a certain level even under the most 
pessimistic circumstances.

So in this case, the worst case is that if key==a[i] will be performed n times

---

### Why Assume the Worst Case?

> In good weather, a commercial airliner requires 150,000$l$ of fuel to cross the Atlantic ocean.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

> In poor weather, it requires 200,000$l$ of fuel.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

> In *most* circumstances it is unacceptable for an algorithm to fail.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: We can compare different cases, but prepare for the worst to guarantee the minimum that the algorithm can achieve.

--

## What actually **is** the worst case?

For all possible outcomes...
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

which is the one that results in the most work being carried out?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
