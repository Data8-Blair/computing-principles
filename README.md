# Computing Principles

This module segment covers introductory computing principles. 


## Lectures

The material is presented as a series of lectures and some code examples.

The online lectures are available [here](https://uea-teaching.github.io/computing-principles/).

I will make the slides available online *and* I will try to keep this material low-bandwidth.
